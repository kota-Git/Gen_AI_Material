        "Our preferred method for running the code locally is through a version-controlled environment with Conda.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Installing Miniconda\n",
        "To setup a conda environment that contains both Python and all the necessary dependencies, we advise you to use a minimal version of conda, aptly named miniconda.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, based on your operating system, we choose an installer that has python 3.10 pre-installed. To illustrate, we would install the following on Windows:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "and the following on Linux:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Setting up a Conda Environment\n",
        "After installation, you will need to open up your terminal and create your environment as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "```conda create -n thellmbook python=3.10```\n",
        "\n",
        "We will need to activate the environment first before we can use it:\n",
        "\n",
        "```conda activate thellmbook```\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Installing Dependencies\n",
        "After creating our environment, we will need to install all the dependencies. If you created your environment using the environment.yml file, you can skip over this.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two methods that you can follow to install the dependencies:\n",
        "\n",
        "Install all dependencies with requirements.txt which requires Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0\n",
        "Install base depedencies with requirements_base.txt which requires specific installations in certain chapters\n",
        "The first method, is to directly install all dependencies (aside from Chapter 11) using the requirements.txt by running the following from the root of this repository:\n",
        "\n",
        "```pip install -r requirements.txt```\n",
        "\n",
        "This should install all necessary dependencies in the environment we just created.\n",
        "\n",
        "Tip\n",
        "\n",
        "If pip install -r requirements.txt is throwing an error, run this which will resolve the error\n",
